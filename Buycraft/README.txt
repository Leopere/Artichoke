---- THANK YOU FOR DOWNLOADING THE BUYCRAFT PLUGIN ------------------------

Purchase premium for added features such as an online webstore (https://example.buycraft.net)

You may contact a member of support via visiting the support link inside of your server panel located at https://server.buycraft.net.


--- INSTALLATION --- ------------------------------------------------------

Please run the command "/buycraft secret <Secret Key>" in game/console, to find your secret key go to https://server.buycraft.net and visit the server settings page.
Refer to installation videos and tutorials available on Buycraft.net for more help/info.


---- MCMYADMIN INTERGRATION ------------------------------------------------

If you are aiming to use McMyAdmin commands in packages, prefix the commands you enter with "{mcmyadmin}", for example,
to execute the McMyAdmin "stop" command, you would enter this: "{mcmyadmin}stop". After you have setup the commands, you need
to give administrator access to the user "Buycraft" (Case sensitive) in the McMyAdmin permissions page. The user "Buycraft" has
been disabled from logging in to your server, to prevent administrator access in game.


---- CHANGING THE /BUY COMMAND ---------------------------------------------

If you are using a plugin which already uses the /buy command, follow the instructions below to fix this problem:
	
	1. Download a program such as WinRar which is capable of opening .jar files.
	2. Open the Buycraft.jar file with the archive program you previously downloaded.
	3. Inside Buycraft.jar, you will find a file called plugin.yml, open this file with a text editor.
	4. Scroll down to line 7 of the plugin.yml file, and change "buy" to either "donate", "store", "shop", or "purchase".
	5. Open language.conf  which is located in the Buycraft directory, and change the "mainCommand" variable to the command which you chose above.
	6. Save all modified files, and restart your server - job done!


---- PERMISSION NODES -----------------------------------------------------

Listed below are the permission nodes for the plugin:

	buycraft.admin - Enables use of the "/buycraft <reload/forcecheck/secret>" commands


---- A FURTHER NOTE --------------------------------------------------------

You are welcome to modify or improve the supplied source code inside of the jar file, however releasing it is not
allowed and you will be banned from accessing the Buycraft API.
